- Washington

## Getting Started

Go to [Python](https://python.org/downloads) to download the latest version of Python for your operating system and
follow the installation instructions.

In the terminal, install the following third party libraries:
`pip install numpy`
`pip install pandas`

There is then no need to import these. Just run:
`python bikeshare_2.py`
