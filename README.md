### Bikeshare Project

Explore U.S. Bikeshare data with the help of Python. An interactive experience is created whereby users can choose to
filter data by the following cities and calculate insightful statistics:

- Chicago
- New York City
- Washington

### Getting Started

Go to [Python](https://python.org/downloads) to download the latest version of Python for your operating system and
follow the installation instructions.

In the terminal, install the following third party libraries:
`pip install numpy`
`pip install pandas`

There is then no need to import these. Just run:
`python bikeshare_2.py`

### Issues

`Datetime` attribute `.day_name()` may need to be replaced by `.weekday_name` if you're already running an older
version of Python. Check the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html).
